# LightAndDark
â€‹Welcome to Light and Dark, this is a two player competitive game where you want to gain as many points as possible. 
There are two player characters in Light and Dark, Sun and Moon. Sun (the blue rabbit) needs to light up the stools by pressing F when near them to gain points. 
Moon (the pink bear) needs to extinguish these lights by doing the same. 
After two minutes the time runs out and whoever has the most points wins. 
Each player can sabotage the other by shooting projectiles at each other in an attempt to knock the player off the platform, to give some time where you can gain points.
